# Temperature anomaly maps with NASA data
In this repo, you'll learn how to use NASA's temperature anomaly data to create detailed maps in R. We'll cover how to reproject the data into different map projections, including Robinson and Orthographic, and how to visualize it using ggplot2. This guide is perfect for anyone interested in climate data or mapping in R.
